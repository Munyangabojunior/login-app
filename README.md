# Login Application with React and Node.js Backend

This project is a simple login application built with a React frontend and a Node.js/Express backend. It demonstrates how to create a user authentication system with registration and login functionalities, protected routes, and token-based authentication using JWT (JSON Web Token).

## Features

- **User Registration**: New users can create an account by providing an email and password.
- **User Login**: Existing users can log in with their credentials.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure user authentication using JSON Web Tokens.
- **Protected Routes**: Access to certain routes is restricted to authenticated users only.
- **Form Validation**: Basic validation for email and password fields.
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages for failed login or registration attempts.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- React
- Axios
- React Router (for navigation)
- Bootstrap (for styling, optional)

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB (with Mongoose)
- bcrypt (for password hashing)
- jsonwebtoken (for token generation and verification)
- cors (for handling cross-origin requests)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- MongoDB installed and running

### Installation

#### Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/login-app.git
cd login-app
```

#### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:

    ```sh
    cd backend
    ```

2. Install backend dependencies:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add your MongoDB connection string and a secret key for JWT:

    ```
    MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/login-app
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
    ```

4. Start the backend server:

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

   The backend server will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

#### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:

    ```sh
    cd ../frontend
    ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the React development server:

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

   The frontend server will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Register a new account by providing an email and password.
3. Log in using the registered email and password.
4. Access protected routes after logging in.
